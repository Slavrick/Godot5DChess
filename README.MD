# GODOT 5D CHESS Project



This is a fun little project for me, my only goal is to make a cool little analysis tool for 5D chess in godot. Godot should allow my previous project to bit a bit less clunky and more portable.



I used GitHub Copilot to initially port the code over, Im a little nervous about bugs and performance but CSharp and Java should be similar enough that hopefully there is no issues.
